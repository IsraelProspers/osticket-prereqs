I Created a virtual Machine in Asure, then browsed to the website (whatismypublicipaddress.com) From Within the virtual machine, I browsed to the website again, which gave me an ip adress and then I marked it down on my text files enabling me to have two entries From the virtual machine i signed up a free version of proton VPN, then i downloaded the client and installed. From within the VM, I connected it to the proton VPN server in another country. Then once I connected it, I browesed back into the website (whatismyipaddress.com) again. I got another ipadress and a location. Finally, I marked it down as an original text file making it three entries.

I used Assure to set up the environment and created a resource group, virtual network, subnet, and two virtual machines. One of the virtual machine was a Domain Controller and the 2nd operated as Client. Then I installed active directory on one of the domain controller virtual machines and then i joined the Client 1 virtual machine to the domain controller virtual machine. I created a bunch of user accounts on the Domain Controller virtual machine, then I created a few folders and shared them out on a network and practiced file and network sharing and performed some DNS activities

I created resources in Assure, installed prerequisites and ticketing systems. I set up SLAs in users and permissions. I used the ticketing system as a help desk professional and created tickets and made some notes on the tickets and closed tickets.
